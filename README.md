The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city worldwide. This project uses Node.js for the server-side, Express.js as the web framework, and the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. The app consists of a user-friendly HTML interface where users can enter the name of a city to retrieve its current weather conditions, including temperature and weather description.

Purpose of the App
The main goal of this project is to help beginners understand how web applications work by combining front-end and back-end technologies. It also introduces them to working with APIs, which are essential for modern web development.

Components of the Project
1. Server-Side Code (Node.js and Express.js)
The server-side code is written in JavaScript and runs on Node.js. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Dependencies:

Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
HTTPS: A Node.js module that allows making HTTP requests.
Body-parser: A middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers.
Basic Structure:

The application listens for incoming requests on a specified port (in this case, 2000).
It serves a static HTML file (sample.html) that contains the user interface for entering the city name.
Upon form submission, it makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the city name provided by the user.
2. Front-End Code (HTML and CSS)
The front-end code is responsible for what the user sees and interacts with. It consists of an HTML form where users can enter a city name and submit it to get weather data.

HTML:

The form includes an input field for entering the city name and a submit button.
A div element is used to display the result of the weather query.
CSS:

Basic styling is applied to make the app visually appealing.
The design features a clean layout with a simple color scheme and well-defined form elements.
3. Weather Data Retrieval
When a user submits a city name, the server processes the request as follows:

Form Submission: The form sends a POST request to the /vss endpoint with the city name.
API Request: The server constructs a URL for the OpenWeatherMap API, including the city name and API key.
Data Handling:
The server makes an HTTPS GET request to the API.
It collects data in chunks and processes it when fully received.
The server parses the received data to extract the temperature and weather description.
Response: The server sends the weather information back to the client to be displayed in the browser.
4. Error Handling
If the city name is invalid or if there's an issue with the API request, the app responds with appropriate error messages.
This ensures a smooth user experience, providing feedback when something goes wrong.
